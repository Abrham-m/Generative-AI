# Generative AI Text Creation

This repository contains code for a generative AI model that is capable of creating text based on a given input. The model uses deep learning techniques to generate text that is coherent and semantically relevant.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the generative AI model for text creation, run the following command:

```bash
python generate_text.py --input "input_text"
```

Replace "input_text" with the text you want to use as input for the generative AI model. The model will generate text based on this input.

## Training

If you want to train the generative AI model on a custom dataset, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py --dataset_path "path_to_dataset"
```

Replace "path_to_dataset" with the path to your custom dataset. The model will be trained on this dataset to generate text.
